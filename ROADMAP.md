  - [x] Detect frames and objects in canvas (AABB intersection)
  - [x] Check for path obstacles dynamically
  - [x] Filter visible nodes in path area
  - [x] Performance-optimized (limit to 5 obstacles)

- [x] **Basic Pathfinding with Avoidance**
  - [x] Simple obstacle avoidance algorithm
  - [x] Add clearance around detected obstacles
  - [x] Configurable via UI checkbox
  - [x] Works with orthogonal routing

- [x] **Auto-update on Move**
